## What you should know about Most Online CTFs

- Online CTFs can be found on [CTFtime.org](https://ctftime.org).
- Most CTFs than we will compete in will use [rCTF](https://rctf.redpwn.net), a capture the flag platform devloped by [redpwn](https://redpwn.net), for its scoreboard. 
  - Generally, the only rule is to not hack the scoreboard. 
  - For most online CTFs, there will not be a cap on the number of people we can have per team. However, we recommend that no more than 4 or 5 are on a team for the sake of coordination. 
  - There will only be one account per team for each CTF. Login details are typically shared through a unique login link, rather than a traditional username and password.
